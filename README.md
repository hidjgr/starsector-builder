# Starsector builder
A tool to create and optimize starsector builds

![Screenshot](./screenshot1.png)

# How to run
This tool requires python, with the `tk` library, and Starsector.

In this directory, you have to create links to the `data/hulls` and
`data/weapons` folders in your Starsector directory.

On Linux, you can use `create_links.sh` for that:

```
$ ./crate_links.sh <Starsector install directory>
```

Then, you can run the tool normally, with `python main.py` or just `./main.py`.
